# Data-analysis-study-projects

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into data science and artificial intelligence studies. Here, my goal is to explore fundamental concepts of data visualization and master the use of key libraries related to the subject, developing both practical and theoretical skills.

### Study Guide

I am using the article ["20 Data Analytics Projects for All Levels"](https://www.datacamp.com/pt/blog/data-analytics-projects-all-levels), available on the DataCamp blog, as a reference. This material serves as a structured guide, offering challenges and practical examples to enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization.

### Objective

This repository will consist of a series of 20 challenges, all based on the mentioned guide. The focus is to learn and apply data analysis and visualization techniques, solidifying concepts through practice and utilizing the most relevant technologies in the field.

### Technologies Covered

- **_Python_**: The main programming language for the projects.
- **_NumPy_**: Efficient manipulation of arrays and mathematical operations.
- **_Pandas_**: Analysis and manipulation of tabular data.
- **_Matplotlib_**: Creation of customized graphs and visualizations.
